Just get started with a good Udemy course/ check out harvard's CS50 on YouTube for free!

Here are some tips from my side:
1) Choose your language.
2) Learn the basics.
3) Learn DSA. (Don't wait for completion).
4) Learn some basic mathematics(hacker rank where you can start maths and strengthen your coding concepts).
5) Use codechef and leetcode. Attend all the contests and after contest upsolving and evaluation is a must.
6) And final and Last Practice !!!!!
